Space Invaders Clone written in Python
---------------------------------------

Code was adapted and written by myself and Kevin Olango for a introductory programming course which focused on Python. 
All sprites were open-source. This clone runs the same way the original Space Invaders Arcade game is played, except for minor 
quirks such as no more infinite shooting (holding down the space bar). There is a life count, as well as falling 1-up powerups that
give the hero an extra life. There is only one level implemented as this was a simple project and not meant to be a full blown game.
